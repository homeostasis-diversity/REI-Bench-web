I really want to make something fresh and delicious with them. Can you remind me what we can do with cooked <span class="red">tomatoes</span>?</p></div>
  
  <div class="dialogue-entry"><p><span class="robot">Robot</span>: Absolutely, Alice! Cooked <span class="red">tomatoes</span> can be used in a variety of dishes, like sauces, soups, or even as a topping for salads. They enhance flavors and add a nice texture to the meal.</p></div>
  
  <div class="dialogue-entry"><p><span class="human">Human</span>: That's exactly what I was thinking! I could use them to create a savory sauce for pasta or maybe even a comforting <span class="red">tomato</span> soup. Do we have everything we need to cook the <span class="red">tomatoes</span>, though?</p></div>
  
  <div class="dialogue-entry"><p><span class="robot">Robot</span>: Let me check our supplies. We have a pot for cooking, some spices like salt and pepper, and a cutting board. We seem to be well-equipped for cooking the <span class="red">tomatoes</span> to perfection.</p></div>
  
  <div class="dialogue-entry"><p><span class="human">Human</span>: Perfect! I want to make sure the <span class="red">tomatoes</span> are well-seasoned when we cook them. Could you remind me how to properly prepare the <span class="red">tomatoes</span> before cooking?</p></div>
  
  <div class="dialogue-entry"><p><span class="robot">Robot</span>: Certainly! First, we should wash the <span class="red">tomatoes</span> thoroughly, then chop them into even pieces to ensure they cook evenly. After that, we can sauté them with the spices until they reach the desired consistency.</p></div>
  
  <div class="dialogue-entry"><p><span class="human">Human</span>: Great, that sounds easy enough! Let's get started with cooking the <span class="red">tomatoes</span>. Once they're cooked and ready, I'll need you to put a cooked <span class="red">tomato</span> into the refrigerator.</p></div>
